# Using Git Worktrees

## Overview

Git worktrees create isolated workspaces within a single repository, allowing you to work on multiple branches simultaneously without switching contexts or managing multiple clones. This skill provides a systematic approach to setting up git worktrees with proper directory selection and safety verification.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Starting feature work that needs isolation from your current workspace
- Before executing implementation plans where you need a clean, isolated environment
- Working on multiple branches in parallel without context switching
- You need baseline tests to pass before beginning work

## Key Features

- **Smart directory selection** - Follows a priority order to determine where to create worktrees
- **Safety verification** - Ensures .gitignore is properly configured for project-local worktrees
- **Auto-detection** - Automatically detects and runs appropriate setup commands (npm, cargo, pip, poetry, go)
- **Baseline verification** - Runs tests to ensure the worktree starts in a clean state
- **Integration** - Designed to work with other skills like brainstorming and plan execution

## Core Principle

Systematic directory selection + safety verification = reliable isolation.
