# Using Superpowers

## Overview

This is the foundational skill for working with the superpowers skill system. It establishes the mandatory protocols and workflows that must be followed when working with any skills. This skill is essential for understanding how to properly leverage all other skills available to you.

## When to Use

Use this skill:

- When starting any conversation or task
- Before responding to any user message
- Before beginning ANY work that might have relevant skills
- To understand the mandatory first response protocol

## Key Principles

- **If a skill applies, you must use it** - This is non-negotiable and not optional
- **Check for skills before any task** - Never rationalize skipping the skill check
- **Create TodoWrite todos for checklists** - Never work through checklists mentally
- **Follow skills exactly** - Skills document proven techniques that prevent known errors
- **Announce skill usage** - Be transparent about which skill you're using

## Core Concept

Skills document proven techniques that save time and prevent mistakes. Not using available skills means repeating solved problems and making known errors. Using available skills is mandatory, not optional.

## Common Rationalizations to Avoid

- Thinking a task is "simple" - even simple tasks benefit from skill workflows
- Believing you remember a skill - skills evolve, always read the current version
- Assuming a skill is "overkill" - skills exist because simple things become complex
- Thinking you'll do one thing first - check for skills BEFORE doing anything
