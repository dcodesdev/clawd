# Receiving Code Review

A systematic approach to receiving and evaluating code review feedback with technical rigor and verification before implementation.

## Overview

This skill guides you through the process of receiving code review feedback effectively. Rather than performatively agreeing or blindly implementing suggestions, it emphasizes technical correctness and verification of all feedback against your actual codebase context.

## Key Principles

- **Verify before implementing** - Understand why a suggestion is being made before accepting it
- **Ask before assuming** - Request clarification on unclear feedback
- **Technical correctness over social comfort** - Prioritize technical validity over agreement for its own sake

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Receiving code review feedback that seems unclear
- Feedback appears technically questionable
- You need to decide whether to implement a suggestion or push back
- Working with external reviewers who may not understand full context

## Core Workflow

1. **Comprehend** - Fully understand the complete feedback
2. **Restate** - Clarify requirements for mutual understanding
3. **Validate** - Check against actual codebase conditions
4. **Assess** - Evaluate technical appropriateness
5. **Respond** - Acknowledge or provide justified objection before execution

This skill helps you avoid the pitfall of treating symptoms while missing root causes, ensuring your codebase remains healthy and maintainable.
