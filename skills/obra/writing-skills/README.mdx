# Writing Skills

This skill applies Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles to the creation and maintenance of process documentation. It treats skills as "production code for processes" - you write test cases (pressure scenarios with subagents), watch them fail (baseline behavior), write the skill documentation, and verify that agents now comply with the documented process.

## Core Principle

**Creating skills IS Test-Driven Development applied to process documentation.**

If you didn't watch an agent fail without the skill, you don't know if the skill teaches the right thing.

## Key Concepts

- **The Iron Law**: No skill without a failing test first
- **RED-GREEN-REFACTOR**: Same TDD cycle adapted for documentation
  - RED: Run pressure scenarios without the skill, document baseline behavior
  - GREEN: Write minimal skill documentation that addresses those failures
  - REFACTOR: Close loopholes and iterate until bulletproof
- **Rationalization Management**: Build explicit counters to agent rationalizations
- **Search Optimization**: Rich descriptions with triggers and symptoms for discovery

## Skill Types

1. **Technique**: Concrete methods with steps to follow
2. **Pattern**: Ways of thinking about problems
3. **Reference**: API docs, syntax guides, tool documentation

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- Creating new skills for your team or agents
- Editing existing skills to close loopholes
- Verifying skills work before deployment
- Need to ensure skills are bulletproof against rationalization
- Building reusable process documentation

## Key Testing Principles

- Test with pressure scenarios that combine multiple stressors
- Document exact rationalizations agents use when they fail
- Write minimal documentation addressing those specific violations
- Iterate through refactor cycles until bulletproof
- Never skip testing for "simple additions" or "documentation updates"
