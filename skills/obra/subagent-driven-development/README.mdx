# Subagent-Driven Development

A comprehensive workflow for executing implementation plans with built-in quality gates. This skill dispatches fresh subagents for each independent task within the current session, followed by mandatory code reviews between tasks to catch issues early while maintaining fast iteration velocity.

Use this skill when you have a detailed implementation plan with mostly independent tasks that you want to execute in the current session. It ensures high code quality through structured review checkpoints while avoiding context pollution and enabling rapid progress.
