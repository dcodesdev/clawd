# Verification Before Completion

## Overview

This skill establishes a non-negotiable protocol for verifying work before claiming completion. It prevents false completion claims by requiring fresh verification evidence from actual command execution before making any success assertions.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- About to claim work is complete, fixed, or passing
- Before committing code changes
- Before creating pull requests
- Before claiming that tests pass, builds succeed, or requirements are met
- Before moving to the next task

## Core Principle

**Evidence before claims, always.**

Claiming work is complete without verification is dishonesty, not efficiency. This skill enforces a five-step gate function before any completion assertion.

## The Iron Law

```
NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE
```

If you haven't run the verification command in this message, you cannot claim it passes.

## Why This Matters

- Trust is broken when completion is claimed without proper verification
- Undefined functions and missing requirements have shipped as a result
- Time is wasted on false completion claims that require rework
- Credibility depends on honesty about work status

This protocol is non-negotiable.
