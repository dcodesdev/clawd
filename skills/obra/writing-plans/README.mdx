# Writing Plans

This skill guides the creation of comprehensive implementation plans for engineers who have zero context about your codebase. It emphasizes breaking work into bite-sized tasks (2-5 minutes each), following Test-Driven Development principles, and providing complete code examples with exact file paths and verification steps.

## Key Features

- **Bite-Sized Granularity**: Each task is a single action (write test, run test, implement code, verify, commit)
- **Complete Context**: Includes exact file paths, complete code examples (not abstract descriptions), and precise commands
- **TDD Methodology**: Separates failing test writing, test verification, implementation, and validation
- **Structured Format**: Standardized header with goal, architecture overview, and tech stack details
- **Execution Handoff**: Offers clear choices for implementation approach (subagent-driven or parallel session)

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- Design is complete and you're ready for implementation
- Engineers need detailed, step-by-step instructions
- You want to ensure consistent task granularity
- Following TDD principles for implementation
- Creating plans for developers unfamiliar with your codebase

## DRY, YAGNI, TDD, Frequent Commits

The skill emphasizes these core principles:

- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid redundant documentation
- **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: Only document what's needed for the task
- **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: Tests before implementation
- **Frequent Commits**: Commit after completing verification steps
