# Systematic Debugging

A disciplined four-phase debugging framework that ensures you find root causes before proposing fixes. This skill prevents wasted time on symptom fixes by requiring thorough investigation, pattern analysis, hypothesis formation, and scientific testing before implementing any solution.

Use this skill when encountering any bug, test failure, or unexpected behavior. It guides you through root cause investigation, comparing against working examples, testing hypotheses minimally, and implementing targeted fixes that address the actual problem rather than masking symptoms.
