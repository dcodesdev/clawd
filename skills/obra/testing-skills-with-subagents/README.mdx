title: Testing Skills With Subagents
description: Apply Test-Driven Development principles to process documentation and skill design. Learn to test skills through scenario execution - run without the skill to observe failures (RED), write the skill addressing failures (GREEN), then close loopholes (REFACTOR). Master pressure scenario design and bulletproof skill verification.

## Testing Skills With Subagents

This skill teaches how to apply Test-Driven Development principles to process documentation and skill design. It extends TDD concepts beyond code to ensure skills are robust, clear, and resistant to rationalization.

### The Testing Approach

The fundamental methodology follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle adapted for skills:

- **RED**: Execute scenarios without the skill present and document agent failures
- **GREEN**: Create or refine the skill to address observed failures
- **REFACTOR**: Identify new rationalizations and add explicit counters

### When to Apply

Use this testing methodology for skills that:
- Require sustained discipline
- Have compliance costs (time, effort)
- Risk rationalization ("just this once")
- Conflict with immediate goals

Skip testing for reference materials or skills without violation risks.

### Pressure Scenario Design

Effective skill tests combine multiple pressures: time constraints, sunk costs, exhaustion, and authority pressure. Key elements include concrete options, specific constraints, real file paths, and no escape hatches.

### Success Indicators

A skill succeeds when agents:
- Select correct options under maximum pressure
- Cite skill sections as justification
- Acknowledge temptation while maintaining compliance
- Confirm through meta-testing that documentation was sufficiently clear
