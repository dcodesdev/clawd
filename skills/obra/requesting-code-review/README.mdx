# Requesting Code Review

A systematic approach to requesting code reviews early and often to catch issues before they compound across your codebase.

## Overview

This skill guides you through requesting code reviews using a structured process. The fundamental practice is "Review early, review often" to catch problems before they multiply and become harder to fix.

## Key Principles

- **Review early** - Request reviews at natural breakpoints in development
- **Review often** - Make code review a regular part of your workflow
- **Provide context** - Always include what was implemented and why
- **Act on feedback** - Take findings seriously and address them promptly

## When to Request

**Mandatory Reviews:**

- After each task in subagent-driven development
- After completing major features
- Before merging to main

**Optional but Valuable:**

- When stuck on implementation
- Before refactoring
- After fixing complex bugs

## The Process

1. **Capture Git References** - Get starting commit (BASE_SHA) and ending commit (HEAD_SHA)
2. **Dispatch Review Request** - Include what was implemented, original plan/requirements, and git SHAs
3. **Address Feedback** - Fix critical issues immediately, important issues before proceeding, and track minor issues for later

## Critical Rules

Never skip review assuming simplicity. Always address critical findings. Don't dismiss valid technical feedback, even if it requires rework.

This skill helps you maintain code quality consistently by integrating comprehensive review into your standard development workflow.
