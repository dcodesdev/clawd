# Doc Co-Authoring

A structured skill for collaboratively authoring documentation, technical specifications, proposals, and similar structured content. This skill guides users through an efficient workflow that helps transfer context, refine content iteratively, and validate documents work for readers before sharing.

## Workflow Stages

1. **Context Gathering** - Collect necessary information and establish the documentation scope
2. **Refinement & Structure** - Organize and improve the content iteratively
3. **Reader Testing** - Validate that the document works for its intended audience

## Use Cases

- Writing technical specifications and design documents
- Creating proposals and business documents
- Drafting decision documents (ADRs)
- Co-authoring structured documentation
- Collaborative content refinement

This skill helps ensure documentation is clear, well-structured, and ready for its intended audience.
