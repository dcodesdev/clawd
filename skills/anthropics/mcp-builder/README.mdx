## Overview

The mcp-builder skill provides a comprehensive framework for developing MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that enable language models to interact seamlessly with external services. Whether you're building servers in Python using FastMCP or in Node/TypeScript using the MCP SDK, this guide ensures your implementations are high-quality and production-ready.

## Key Phases

The mcp-builder skill covers development across four main phases:

1. **Research and Planning** - Define your MCP server's purpose and capabilities
2. **Implementation** - Build your MCP server using FastMCP or MCP SDK
3. **Review and Testing** - Ensure quality and reliability of your tools
4. **Evaluation Creation** - Develop comprehensive evaluation metrics

## Best Practices

This skill emphasizes:

- **Balanced API Coverage** - Thoughtful selection of tools and capabilities
- **Clear Tool Naming** - Intuitive and descriptive function names
- **Actionable Error Messaging** - Help language models understand and resolve issues
- **Real-World Integration** - Enable models to accomplish practical tasks through external service integration

## Supported Technologies

- **Python**: FastMCP framework
- **Node/TypeScript**: Official MCP SDK

Use this skill when building MCP servers to integrate external APIs or services that language models can leverage.
