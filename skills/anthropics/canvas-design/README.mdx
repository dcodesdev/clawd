# Canvas Design

## Overview

This skill enables the creation of beautiful visual art in PNG and PDF formats through a philosophy-driven design approach. It treats design as art objects rather than decorated documents, emphasizing spatial relationships, chromatic intention, and compositional precision.

## Core Principles

- **Visual-first approach** - Information lives in design elements, not explanatory text
- **Expert craftsmanship** - Output should appear meticulously labored, as if created by a master-level practitioner
- **Sophisticated subtlety** - Conceptual references integrate invisibly into the composition
- **Minimalist discipline** - Text remains sparse, functional, and integrated as a visual accent
- **Artistic freedom** - The philosophy guides without constraining creative interpretation

## Key Workflow

The skill operates in two primary phases:

### 1. Design Philosophy Creation

Develop an aesthetic movement or visual worldview that emphasizes form, space, color, and composition over text. This philosophical foundation guides all subsequent design decisions.

### 2. Canvas Expression

Translate that philosophy into a museum-quality PDF or PNG, prioritizing visual communication with minimal, strategically-placed typography. The output should demonstrate:

- Meticulous attention to spatial relationships
- Intentional color theory and chromatic choices
- Compositional precision and balance
- Integration of conceptual depth

## Use Cases

Use this skill when users request:

- Creating posters or artwork
- Designing static visual pieces
- Building professional graphic designs
- Developing visual concepts for presentations or materials

**Note:** Always create original work rather than copying existing artists to avoid copyright violations.
